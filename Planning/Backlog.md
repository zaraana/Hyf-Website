## BACKLOG:

A collection of user stories you can choose from. Stories inside of each priority level are not necessarily in order. You and your team will decide when to develop each story by drawing out your Story Sequencing.

## USER STORY:

In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system.

### Must-Haves

* As a user, I expect the website to be the navigation bar at first login.
* As a user, I would like to understand briefly and clearly what the program is.
* As a user ,I want to see the details of the program and how I can apply.
* As a user, I want to get in touch quickly. 

### Should-Haves

### Could-Haves
