# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

## Stop Doing

<!--
  what did your group do that did not go very well
  agree to stop doing this in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - pushing changes directly to master/main branch
  - claiming more issues at once than you can finish
-->

## Continue Doing

<!--
  what did your group that worked well
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->

- Have meetings whenever it's possible for all group members;
- Discuss all the step needed to accomplish a task;
- Explain even the simplest task once and twice using screen share and making all the group members trying it so to make sure that everyone understood it;
- Help each other;
- Do one task all together;
- Promote pair-programming

## Start Doing

<!--
  what ideas does your group have for making a better project next time?
  agree to give these things a try in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - use @mentions more often
  - use the github integration in slack. /github
-->

- I think we need to start coding and deliver earlier than Thursday, for having any of the coaches to review the group project and improve as group.

## Learned Lessons

<!--
  what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?
  This can be about anything! code, collaboration, git, github, ...

- Don't be ashamed to say "I didn't get it!"
